Je n&#39;ai jamais pu mettre un mot sur ce que je vivais et\r\nressentais. Personne ne m’avait informée que je pouvais me sentir\r\naussi mal sans pour autant souffrir physiquement. Et pourtant c’etait le\r\ncas . L’enfant en moi aurait voulu qu’on lui dise ‘’ tu es belle ‘’,la jeune\r\nfille que j’ étais aurait voulu qu’on lui dise ‘’crois en toi’’,la jeune femme\r\naurait aimé entendre ‘’ sois authentique’’ .\r\n\r\nHelas !il m’a fallu 23 ans pour oser me le dire et decouvrir que toute ma\r\nvie j’ai ete en manque cruel d’estime de soi . Aujourd’hui ,ce temps est\r\nrévolu et je suis heureuse de te partager 3 outils qui m’ont aidée a m’en\r\nsortir.\r\n\r\n## Remplacer les pensées négatives par des pensées positives\r\nL’un des facteurs qui influence négativement l’estime de soi est la\r\npensée négative ,comme le dit l’adage : on devient ce que l’on pense\r\n.Si tu crois que tu n’y arriveras pas ,tu ne le feras pas.Si au contraire tu\r\nte nourris de pensées positives qui te motivent à passer a l’action,tu\r\nréaliseras bien plus que ce que tu penses pouvoir faire.\r\n\r\n## Prononcer uniquement des mots doux et bienveillants à ton égard.\r\nJ’ai été la championne des paroles dévalorisantes à mon intention,cela\r\nne faisait que diminuer le peu d’estime que j’avais de moi-même. Cesse\r\ndonc cette mauvaise habitude.Si tu as du mal à te les répéter\r\n,commence par les écrire et répété les mentalement jusqu’a pouvoir les\r\nprononcer.\r\n\r\n## Mets en pratique les outils précédents des maintenant.\r\nTu constateras en peu de temps un plus grand sentiment de bonheur et\r\nde bien etre ainsi qu’une meilleure sante mentale globale et des\r\nresultats positives qui peuvent en decouler."

    "content": "Il a fallu quitter la maison pour réaliser que cet humain qui m&#39;a pourri la vie\r\ndurant des années était en réalité l&#39;une des personnes que j&#39;aime le plus au\r\nmonde. Cet être que j&#39;ai vu grandir et avec qui j&#39;ai eu une relation conflictuelle\r\njusqu&#39;à mon départ du cocon familial. Chers lecteurs, je vous présente mon\r\nfrère.\r\n\r\nCe jeune homme de  deux ans, mon cadet, au sourire large et sincère, aux\r\nyeux noirs pétillants d&#39;intelligence et de malice, et d&#39;un charisme indéniable.\r\n\r\nHélas, ce n&#39;est pas cette description que j&#39;aurais faite il y a de cela quelques\r\nannées ; je lui aurais ajouté deux cornes, de grandes oreilles et une vilaine\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\nPour comprendre l&#39;histoire, il faut remonter à des années où mes parents (je\r\nles pardonne aujourd&#39;hui) ont eu l&#39;ingénieuse idée d&#39;avoir un second enfant.\r\nJe n&#39;avais sûrement pas conscience, mais j&#39;étais persuadée qu&#39;à cette\r\népoque je me réjouissais de gouverner à moi seule mon royaume : une jolie\r\nfillette joyeuse et pleine de gaieté qui croquait la vie à pleines dents.\r\n\r\nCependant, le destin en a voulu autrement. Il a fallu que mon frère naisse,\r\nqu&#39;il me suive partout et qu&#39;en grandissant, il remette en jeu mon droit\r\nd&#39;aînesse. J&#39;aurais dû me méfier quand il a commencé à casser mes jouets et\r\nà torturer mes poupées. J&#39;ai voulu, dans ma grande bonté, lui accorder le\r\nbénéfice du doute ; c&#39;était mal le connaître. Non seulement il me piquait mes\r\naffaires, mais en plus, je me faisais gronder par sa faute.\r\n\r\nS&#39;en sont suivies des années de prises de tête au grand désarroi de mes\r\nparents, qui en avaient marre de nous entendre. Je ne compte plus les\r\noccasions où j&#39;aurais souhaité répondre affirmativement à ceux qui me\r\ndemandaient si j&#39;étais fille unique.\r\n\r\nJe ne compte plus les fois où, par sa faute, nous avons été punis. Mon frère\r\navait ce don de se surpasser à chaque fois et de me faire sortir de mes\r\ngonds. Un jour, un souvenir que je n&#39;oublierai jamais, il a été au summum de\r\nses compétences. C&#39;était une de ces journées ensoleillées du mois de juin, il\r\nfaisait beau, c&#39;étaient les grandes vacances, j&#39;avais douze  ans et lui dix .\r\n\r\nJ&#39;entendis ma mère lui demander d&#39;aller récupérer un colis non loin de notre\r\nmaison, chez madame Dieuseul. Enchanté à l&#39;idée de jouer avec le fils de\r\ncette dernière, il partit aussitôt.\r\n\r\nUne demi-heure plus tard, ma mère, n&#39;ayant aucune nouvelle, vint me\r\ndemander d&#39;aller le chercher. À contrecœur, j&#39;obéis et parcourus les quelques\r\nmètres qui nous séparaient de chez madame Dieuseul.\r\n\r\nArrivée là-bas, je le trouvai en train de jouer au domino. Il fit mine de ne pas\r\nme voir et continua sa partie, comme si sa vie en dépendait.\r\n\r\n— Ti kompé manmi voye chèchew.\r\n\r\n— Map vini, yon dènye pati.\r\n\r\nEntre-temps, Adeline, une copine du quartier qui passait par là, me rejoignit\r\npour papoter. Hypnotisée par ses anecdotes drôles, je me rendis compte\r\nqu&#39;une heure s&#39;était écoulée quand mon frère, après une énième défaite,\r\ndécida de rentrer. Frappée de plein fouet par la réalité, mon cœur se mit à\r\nbattre la chamade. Mon intuition me disait que nous étions dans le pétrin. Mes\r\ndoutes n&#39;ont pas tardé à se confirmer lorsque nous trouvâmes notre mère au\r\nseuil du portail, nous dévisageant à tour de rôle d&#39;un air menaçant qui disait :\r\nvotre sort est scellé.\r\n\r\nChers lecteurs, je vous épargne les détails : ce fut mémorable.\r\n\r\nVous comprenez mieux maintenant que j&#39;ai eu toutes les raisons du monde\r\npour le détester.\r\n\r\nCependant, je n&#39;y arrive pas, non pas qu&#39;il ait changé(il a toujours cette\r\nmanie de me taquiner), je me suis rendu compte qu&#39;il est le frère que j&#39;aurais\r\naimé avoir : avenant, empathique, taquin, dévoué et emmerdeur. Bien\r\nentendu, il n&#39;a pas hérité de ma beauté légendaire, mais je suis trop\r\nreconnaissante de l&#39;avoir.\r\n\r\nUn frère, une sœur, est un cadeau. Pour cette nouvelle année, je vous invite à\r\nchérir vos frères et sœurs, qu&#39;ils soient de sang ou de cœur.Il n&#39;a pas fait que\r\nme pourrir la vie, mais il l&#39;a aussi embellie, et c&#39;est pour cela que je peux\r\naffirmer avec conviction : quoi qu&#39;il advienne, ce ne sera jamais sans\r\nmon frère."

    "content": "Je n'oublierai jamais le jour où j’ai appris deux des plus belles leçons de vie\r\npar l’un de mes potes. Arrivé chez moi un soir de janvier et emmitouflé dans\r\nsa combinaison d’hiver qu’il s’empressait déjà d’enlever, il jeta un regard\r\ncirculaire dans l’appartement où je venais d’emménager. Il ouvrit la\r\nconversation avec les sujets habituels que j’aimais à savoir : sa mère qui lui\r\nreprochait d’être encore célibataire, sa lassitude du froid, son désir de\r\nretourner au bercail,( Haïti), sans oublier l’évocation de nos merveilleux\r\nsouvenirs du secondaire.\r\n\r\nComme toujours je l’écoutais en riant car je prenais plaisir à l’entendre. Je le\r\nconnaissais depuis trop longtemps pour me lasser de ses anecdotes. C’est\r\nmon pote jusqu’à la muerte , et il le restera qu’il soit radoteur ou pas.\r\nC’est ainsi que débuta notre soirée empreinte de fou-rires. À un moment\r\ndonné, planté au milieu du salon, il me fit une remarque :\r\n\r\n— Pourquoi as-tu cela chez toi ?\r\n\r\nJ’accourus de la cuisine où je nous concoctais un cocktail pour mieux prêter\r\nattention à ses dires. À mon grand étonnement, il ne s’agissait que des\r\ninitiaux H.O.P.E qui étaient posés sur mon bureau. Je lui fis un signe\r\nd’incompréhension car ayant suivi des cours d’anglais au collège,je me\r\ndoutais bien qu’il connaissait le sens de ce mot , mais je lui fis quand même\r\npart de la définition en lui disant :\r\n\r\n— C’est du positif avoir de l’espoir.\r\n\r\nIl me répondit de sa voix basse :\r\n\r\n— Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\r\n\r\nQu’est-ce qu’il allait encore me raconter ce mec ? Me dis-je en levant les yeux\r\nau ciel.\r\n\r\nConvaincue de mon point de vue, je lui demandai de s’expliquer et il me\r\nrépondit :\r\n\r\n— Il est vrai que l’espoir amplifie notre positivité, l’espoir fait vivre, mais il peut\r\naussi tuer à petit feu si on ne fait qu’espérer sans passer à l’action. Combien\r\nde gens ont aspiré à une meilleure vie, et sont restées après des années à la\r\ncase de départ à attendre un miracle ? Il ne suffit pas d’espérer, mais il faut\r\nsurtout croire et poser des actes concrets. On espère que le futur sera\r\nmeilleur, mais que fait-on dans le présent pour que ce futur soit réaliste ? Si\r\non ne vit que dans l’espoir, cela devient un gâchis et une perte de temps.\r\n\r\nJe n’en revenais pas, et pourtant il avait raison.\r\n\r\nCe soir-là en me couchant, j’eus comme une sorte de révélation, une\r\nouverture d’esprit. Souvent, nous passons notre temps à souhaiter le meilleur\r\nsans poser aucune action pour que le meilleur se réalise. On pourrait dire\r\nque, nous ne croyons pas nous-mêmes à nos prédictions. Quelle ironie !\r\nCette soirée n’avait rien extraordinaire et pourtant j’ai appris deux leçons de vie. La première, il ne suffit pas d’esperer pour qu’un changement s’opère\r\ndans notre vie, mais qu’il faut également poser des actions concrètes. La\r\ndeuxième, c’est qu’entre fou-rires et niaiseries, il peut toujours se dégager\r\nune vérité profonde qui pourrait changer le cours de notre vie."

This statement has caused an uproar among affected customers and cybersecurity experts alike, raising questions about data security and corporate responsibility.\r\n\r\n## The Incident\r\n\r\nThe breach, which came to light last month, compromised the personal genetic data of thousands of 23andMe users. Hackers gained access to user profiles, exposing sensitive information such as ancestry details and potential genetic health risks. The breach has raised significant concerns over the security measures employed by the company.\r\n\r\n## Company’s Response\r\n\r\n23andMe has responded by attributing the breach to weak user passwords and poor account security practices. In an official statement, the company suggested that users are to blame for the breach due to their failure to implement strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\r\n\r\n>While we take data security seriously, users must also take responsibility for their own account security by choosing strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.\r\n<cite>23andMe Representative</cite>\r\n\r\n## Public Reaction\r\n\r\nThe public response to 23andMe's stance has been overwhelmingly negative. Many users feel that the company is shifting the blame rather than addressing potential vulnerabilities in their own security systems. Cybersecurity experts have also criticized the company's approach, arguing that robust security protocols should be in place to protect user data, regardless of individual password strength.\r\n\r\n## Lessons Learned\r\n\r\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of data security, both for users and companies handling sensitive information. While it is crucial for individuals to practice good password hygiene and enable additional security measures, companies must also ensure they have comprehensive security systems to safeguard user data.\r\n\r\n## Moving Forward\r\n\r\nAs 23andMe works to regain customer trust, they have pledged to review and strengthen their security protocols. The company has also offered support to affected users, including guidance on how to enhance their personal account security.\r\n\r\nFor users, this breach is a wake-up call to prioritize their digital security. Simple steps such as using unique, complex passwords and enabling two-factor authentication can significantly reduce the risk of such breaches.\r\n\r\nStay updated on the latest developments regarding this breach and learn more about protecting your personal data [here](#!).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you need any modifications or additional information, feel free to let me know!"
